This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
library(ggplot2)
```

@fig-scatterplot shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars.
Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3.5
#| fig-cap: City and highway mileage for 38 popular models of cars.
#| fig-alt: Scatterplot of city vs. highway mileage for cars, where points are colored by the number of cylinders. The plot displays a positive, linear, and strong relationship between city and highway mileage, and mileage increases as the number of cylinders decreases.
